# Ground Truth Data Collection Methodology

## Field Data Surveys

Field data surveys were conducted in January 2023. The objective was to align ground samples with satellite data for enhanced accuracy in our observations.

### Sample Points Identification

- **Satellite Imagery Source:** Sentinel imagery was utilized for identifying sample points.
- **Coordinates Recording:** The coordinates (four corners) of each identified sample point were meticulously recorded.

### Establishment of Field Plots

- **Plot Size:** Each field plot measured 10 m × 10 m.
- **Alignment:** Efforts were made to align each corner of the plot as closely as possible with the corresponding Sentinel pixel.

### Sample Selection

- **Sample Points per Plot:** Within each plot, 5 samples were selected:
  - One from each corner.
  - One from the centre.
- **Sample Size:** Each sample measured 1 m × 1 m.

### Sample Collection

- **Total Samples:** A total of 57 samples were collected from various grassland areas:
  - Enclosed grasslands.
  - Communal grasslands.
  - Irrigated forage areas.
- **Pre-collection Preparation:** All gravel and litter were removed from each sample point before collection.
- **Data Recorded:** For each plot, the latitude, longitude, and fresh Above Ground Biomass (AGB) were recorded.

### Above Ground Biomass (AGB) Determination

- **Procedure:** The aboveground portions of the grass within the sample plots were harvested.
- **Biomass Measurement:** The dried biomass was then weighed.
- **Data Expression:** The dried AGB values were expressed in kilograms per hectare (kg/ha).
